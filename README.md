# Climate Change Statistics and Trends

#Climate change data analysis based on World Bank data
For the purpose of analysing statistical trends, three indicators on climate change were chosen across 10 countries. The chosen indicators are CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption (kt), Urban population, Arable land (% of land area). The countries chosen are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, United Kingdom, Ghana, India, Nigeria, and United States.

#C02 emissions from liquid fuel consumption vs Urban Population

The plot above, is a plot that shows the rate of “C02 emissions from liquid fuel consumption (kt)” across 10 different countries, from diverse region, and from the year 1966 to 2016 in a gap 10 years each. The plot shows that the United States is the highest consumer of liquid fuel among the ten countries.

Among the ten countries in the plot, it can be seen that the United States have always had the highest consumption of liquid fuel. The plot also shows that China and India have a rapid increase in the consumption of liquid fuel. The high consumption of liquid fuel in the United States over the years, shows that, it has a very highest emission of Co2 among the 10 countries.

Increase in population, most times tend to come with an increase in the consumption of fuel. From the plot above in relation to the plot of liquid fuel consumption on the left hand side, it can be seen that as the Urban population of China increases, so does the C02 emissions from liquid fuel consumption (kt) in China increases.

Also, it can be seen that as the Urban population of India increases, so does the rate of C02 emissions from liquid fuel consumption increases.

#Arable land(% of land area) vs Urban Population

Arable land are lands that are apt for cultivating crops. It comprises of land that is being used for agricultural purposes as well as land that could be transformed to farm use.

The percentage of a country’s population that resides in urban settlements is known as the Urban population of a country.

In general terms, as a country’s urban population increases, the amount of arable land available reduces. The reason for this is due to the fact that urbanization is mostly followed by industrialization, which can lead to the conversion of agricultural land into industrial and urban areas. From the plot of the “Urban population of 10 countries”, and the plot of “Arable land (% of land area)”, it can be seen that as the Urban population of India increases over the years(1996 to 2016), so does the percentage % area of Arable land reduces.

Furthermore, as a country's urban population increases, the demand for food increases, This increases the pressure on the remaining farm land to produce more food.

Also from the plots, it can be seen that a country like China which is higher in terms of urbanization compared to India, has lesser percentage of Arable land. This shows that countries with higher urbanization tends to have lower percentage of Arable land.

In addition, urbanization creates opportunities for agriculture. For example, as a country increases in urban population, it creates opportunities for farmers to sell there farm produce. Urban areas generate high amount of organic waste, which is being used as a fertilizer for agricultural crops.
